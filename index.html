      <h2>What this site does</h2>
      <p>
        This site collects a small set of leading cure-focused research efforts in Type 1 diabetes
        and shows, in plain language, where they are in the clinical trial process and roughly how
        far away they might be from real-world use.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is meant to give families a sense of the landscape, not to recommend any specific study
        or to replace medical advice.

  <!-- Practical Cure explanation goes HERE -->
  <p class="fine-print">
    *About “Practical Cure” projects: The Juvenile Diabetes Cure Alliance (JDCA) uses the term
    “Practical Cure” for research efforts that could significantly reduce the daily burden of
    type 1 diabetes and meaningfully protect against long-term complications — and that could
    realistically be available within about 15 years if all future studies succeed.
  </p>

  <p class="fine-print">
    To qualify as a Practical Cure, a project must meet key JDCA criteria, including:  
    avoiding chronic immune-suppressing drugs, avoiding highly risky or invasive procedures,
    demonstrating potential for much greater independence from insulin, and showing feasibility
    for broad real-world use (not just small or highly selective patient groups).
  </p>

  <p class="fine-print">
    Some promising research is not included here because it does not currently meet these Practical
    Cure criteria. For example, Vertex’s VX-880 stem-cell–derived islet therapy is an exciting and
    important program, but it currently depends on immune-suppressing drugs and is therefore tracked
    separately by JDCA.

      <h2>What does this mean for my child right now?</h2>

      <h3>1. Today’s tools still matter the most</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Even the most promising cure trials are many years away and still uncertain. The best
          way to protect a child with T1D today is with current therapies: insulin, monitoring,
          and the care plan from their diabetes team.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tech such as CGMs, pumps, and hybrid closed-loop systems has already made day-to-day
          life safer and easier for many families.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. What these trials represent</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Each project here is one piece of a much larger global research effort. Most will
          change, evolve, or even stop over time—that is normal in science.
        </li>
        <li>
          Seeing many different approaches (immune system changes, cell replacement,
          regeneration, and more) is a sign that researchers are exploring multiple paths
          toward the same goal: making life with T1D easier, safer, or eventually insulin-free.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. If you’re curious about clinical trials</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Never make decisions about trials on your own. Talk with your child’s endocrinologist
          or diabetes team first—they know your child’s medical situation best.
        </li>
        <li>
          Clinical trials often have strict age, health, and safety criteria. Many are not
          designed for children yet, or may only be open in certain countries.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Taking care of yourself as a parent</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It can be overwhelming to read about cures that are still years away. It’s okay to
          step back from research and focus on the next meal, the next school day, and the
          next check-up.
